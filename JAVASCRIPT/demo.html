              //JS Variables --------container that keeps either value or not
              //JavaScript variables are containers used to store data values. They are declared using the keywords
              //var, let, or const, with let and const being the preferred methods in modern
              // JavaScript. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't need to specify the data type
              //(e.g., number, string) when declaring a variable.
             //The document in JavaScript is a global object that represents the entire web page loaded in the browser window. It is the entry point for interacting with and manipulating the page's content, structure, and style using the Document Object Model (DOM).

              //using var keyword
              var myname="ABES";
              document.write(myname);//output on browser
              console.log(myname);//output on console
              //JS EXECUTION AND SCOPE IN JS (GLOBAL AND LOCAL[BLOCK])
